# Super Mario Odyssey Any% Randomizer

Simple script that gives you random moons while still fulfilling the Any% requirement of 124 moons

## Setup

Clone the repository by clicking on the green `Clone or Download` button, then selecting download ZIP

Unzip the download to a place of your choosing and run the file named `run.py`

After typing in a seed (leave blank for complete randomness), check the current directory for a file named `randomizer.txt`. Open that file to start!

### IMPORTANT

If you would like to use the randomizer offline, you have to download the moon data from this [link](https://smo.kek.tech/api/v1/moons)

Python 3 **must** be installed to run the program.

## Credits

Massive shoutouts to [candle](https://github.com/candleeater) not only for the moon data but also for making his own randomizer. He utilizes different logic than mine so I believe its worth checking out ([Link](https://smo.kek.tech/api/v1/index#!/rando))

Shoutouts to the Odyssey Speedrunning community as well ([Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/smospeedruns))
