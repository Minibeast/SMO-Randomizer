# Super Mario Odyssey Any% Randomizer

Simple script that gives you random moons while still fulfilling the Any% requirement of 124 moons

## Setup

Clone the repository by clicking on the green `Clone or Download` button, then selecting download ZIP

Unzip the download to a place of your choosing and run the file named `run.py`

After typing in a seed (leave blank for complete randomness), check the current directory for a file named `randomizer.txt`. Open that file to start!

### IMPORTANT

You **must** have Python 3 (more specifically 3.8) for this to work. Python 2 or any other python version will most likely result in an error

## Rules (or lack thereof)

There are two common ways to play SMO Any% Rando: Follow the order generated or route out the correct path. You may choose to play it either way, but keep in mind the Bowser's Kingdom generates the story moons before any other moon meaning world peace will be the first thing achieved if following each line word for word

Massive shoutouts to [candle](https://github.com/candleeater) not only for the moon data but also for making his own randomizer. He utilizes different logic than mine so I believe its worth checking out ([Link](https://smo.kek.tech/api/v1/index#!/rando))
