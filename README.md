Massive shoutouts to [candle](https://github.com/candleeater) not only for the moon data but also for making his own randomizer. He utilizes different logic than mine so I believe its worth checking out ([Link](https://smo.kek.tech/api/v1/index#!/rando))

Shoutouts to the Odyssey Speedrunning community as well ([Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/smospeedruns))
